# Task 1: Data Manipulation with pandas
Description: You are given a dataset containing information about sales transactions. Your task is to use pandas to clean and manipulate the data to answer specific questions. Perform the following tasks:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Remove any duplicate rows or missing values.
Extract a subset of columns that are relevant to the analysis.
Calculate the total sales amount for each category.
Identify the top-selling product and its sales quantity.
Generate a summary report with descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
Export the cleaned and processed data to a new CSV file.

# Task 2: Numerical Analysis with NumPy
Description: You have been provided with a dataset containing numerical data. Utilize NumPy to perform the following tasks:

Load the dataset into a NumPy array.
Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the dataset.
Normalize the data using the z-score normalization technique.
Identify outliers in the dataset using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
Perform element-wise mathematical operations on the dataset (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication).
Reshape the dataset into a different dimension.
Save the processed data as a NumPy binary file.

# Task 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Description: You are given a dataset with multiple variables, and your goal is to create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib. Complete the following tasks:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Create a line plot to visualize the trend of a specific variable over time.
Generate a bar chart to compare the distribution of a categorical variable.
Construct a scatter plot to examine the relationship between two numerical variables.
Design a histogram to display the distribution of a continuous variable.
Customize the visualizations by adding appropriate labels, titles, and legends.
Save the generated plots as image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG).


# Task 4: Advanced Data Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
Description: You are provided with a complex dataset that requires advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques. Accomplish the following tasks:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Perform data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Utilize pandas to create a pivot table for summarizing the data.
Generate a box plot to compare the distributions of multiple variables across different categories.
Create a stacked area chart to visualize the composition of different variables over time.
Develop a heat map to display the correlation matrix of the numerical variables.
Combine multiple visualizations into a dashboard-like layout using Matplotlib's subplots.
Save the final visualization dashboard as a PDF document.
