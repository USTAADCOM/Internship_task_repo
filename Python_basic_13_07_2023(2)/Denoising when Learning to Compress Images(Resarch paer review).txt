Introduction
____________

1:Noisy images has a ISO number with High noise has high value of ISO
2:ISO sensitivity setting, but noise is virtually always present to some extent and it is both incompressible and undesirable
3:A learned lossy image compression
scheme is trained by forwarding the image through an autoencoder (AE) and backpropagating from the loss, whose components are the bitrate and the distortion [5]. 
The bitrate is computed from an optimized, i.e. trained, cumulative distribution function, and the distortion quantifies the difference between the output of the 
autoencoder and the input image, typically by computing the mean square error (MSE).
4) Image noise does not reflect the physical components of the observed scene. It is a consequence of the imperfect acquisition process, and thereby should be 
   ignored when possible
NIND (Natural Image Noise Dataset)
An open dataset of real photographs with real noise, from identical scenes captured with varying ISO values.

Models:
Different image restoration techniques have been developed to tackle image denoising, including 
 1) Wavelet [22, 13] 
 2) Non-local means based methods [11], BM3D [15]
 3) Recent deeplearning based methods [8, 14, 18, 12].
->Targeting the reconstruction of a denoised image is the proper way to proceed to get a faithful representation of reality. 
->The Natural Image Noise Dataset (NIND) [8] and Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) [3] provide sets of clean–noisy image pairs which are appropriate to
  train a denoising neural network
-> more recently the idea of learning denoising and compression jointly with neural networks was approached by Testolina et al. [23] in the context of the JPEG 
  AI codec. The decoder in [23] is extended such that it consists of twice as many layers, and Poissonian-Gaussian noise is applied to the input training data
-> Training a denoiser with synthetic noise tends to produce a poor model on real data [8, 20]. Testolina et al. introduce a promising joint denoising 
   and compression (JDC) scheme but the resulting rate-distortion of their model falls short of that obtained using our proposed supervision based on 
   pairwise naturally noisy / clean images.Best Data Set For Denoising Neural Netwrok

Four different strategies
_________________________
->Four different strategies are envisioned and compared to implement our novel Natural Image Noise Removal (NINR) supervision paradigm.
  1) Noisy Pairs (JDC-N) (Noisy image from clean–noisy paired dataset [8])
     Expected output (Clean ground truth)
  2) Clean and Noisy Pairs (JDC-CN) (Noisy image from clean–noisy paired dataset, clean image from high quality dataset [1])
     Expected output (Clean ground truth and Clean input)
  3) Clean and Low-noise Pairs (JDC-Cn) (Weakly noisy image from clean–noisy paired dataset, clean image from a high quality dataset)
     Expected output (Clean ground truth and Clean input)
  4) Building Pairs from a Universal Denoiser (JDC-UD) (Arbitrary input image [1, 8] )
     Expected output (Provided by a Universal Denoiser)


Section 4:
  -> Implementation based on PyTorch
  -> Data pairs considered in this paper to train a joint denoising and compression model. JDC-Cn is also referred to with its training noise threshold 
    (e.g. JDC-Cn.8 is trained with MS-SSIM ≥ 0.8, see the text for details).

Autoencode Loss Function
_______________________
 Loss x hat + lambda multiply MSE(x hat, x)
 
 -> Balances the rate/distortion trade-off of the model by the lambda
 -> The combined denoising and compression autoencoder [9] is trained with batches of four noisy images from NIND [8] and one clean image from the 
    Wikimedia Commons Featured Pictures [1] dataset whose ISO value does not exceed 200, with a crop size of 256. 
 -> The pre-trained “universal denoiser” used to train the JDC-UD model is the U-Net-like blind denoising model published with NIND
